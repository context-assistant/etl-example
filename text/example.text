Plain text files with the .text extension serve the same purpose as .txt files - they contain unformatted textual content that can be easily read and edited. These files are commonly used for documentation, notes, configuration files, and data storage. The simplicity of plain text makes it an excellent choice for version control systems, as changes are easy to track and merge. Many programming languages use plain text files for source code, configuration, and documentation. The lack of formatting means the file size is minimal and the content is universally accessible across different operating systems and applications. Plain text remains one of the most fundamental and widely supported file formats in computing.
