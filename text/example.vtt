Welcome to this video tutorial. Today we'll be learning about web development.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.000
First, let's start with the basics of HTML and CSS. These are the fundamental building blocks of web pages.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.000
HTML provides the structure of your webpage, while CSS handles the styling and visual presentation.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.000
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to make your websites come alive with user interactions.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Together, these three technologies form the core of modern web development practices.
