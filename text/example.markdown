# Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** that allows you to write formatted text using a simple, readable syntax. It's widely used for documentation, README files, and content management systems.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Documentation** - Technical docs and API references
2. **Blog Posts** - Content creation for static site generators
3. **README Files** - Project documentation on GitHub
4. **Notes** - Personal knowledge management

### Syntax Examples

**Bold** and *italic* text formatting is straightforward. You can also create `inline code` or code blocks:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Lists and Links

- Unordered lists are simple
- Just use dashes or asterisks
- [Links](https://example.com) are easy to add

Markdown files are typically saved with `.md` or `.markdown` extensions and can be converted to HTML, PDF, or other formats.
